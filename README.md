# User Centric Frontend Development Milestone Project

This is a website designed for the 1960's band 'The Monkees' to help promote their social media and availability for booking events to new and potential fans alike. Also including a back catalogue of their music. 


## UX

This project is aimed at existing fans of The Monkees who may be of the older generation. I have attempted to keep the design and interactivity simple and intuitive enough that anybody can make sense of it and make use of the site. 
The site is also aimed at newer potential fans who may be of a younger age group than that of the existing fans. I have attempted to keep a modern sleek design so as to be appealing to a younger audience, following key existing trends in order to do so.
